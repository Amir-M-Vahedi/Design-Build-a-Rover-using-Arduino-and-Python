# Design and Build a Rover using Arduino and Python
## Overview
This project documents the creation of a simple, accessible Rover designed for easy assembly and implementation. The final assembled Rover is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor for object detection and collision avoidance. Mechanical drawings are provided to support the assembly process. An Arduino script controls the Rover's motion, while a Python-based GUI enables Bluetooth communication for remote control and feedback.
